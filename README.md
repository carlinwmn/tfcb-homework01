| main | This file initializes the model and trains the model, after which training is evaluated and the model is tested. |
| get_dataset     | Functions for downloading and handling the datasets.   |
| get_species_list   | Script to create a .csv file with the species that are imaged the most. Images are pulled from [AntWeb](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/13b70480-bd69-11dd-b15f-b8a03c50a862).  |
| predict_image   | Load a model with trained weights and predict an image or a test set.   |
